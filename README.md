# Flick

![Flick in action](https://github.com/saket/Flick/blob/master/screenshots/flick_demo.gif)

Flick is a tiny library for flick dismissing images (or anything actually). You can read the announcement [blog post](http://saket.me/?p=707) to learn how Flick was created.

```
implementation 'me.saket:flick:1.4.0'
```

## Usage

The [sample project](https://github.com/saket/Flick/tree/master/sample/src/main/java/me/saket/flick/sample) contains best practices for using Flick. You can [download its APK from here](https://github.com/saket/Flick/releases) for trying it out on your phone.

```xml
<me.saket.flick.FlickDismissLayout
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="wrap_content">

  <ImageView
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>
</me.saket.flick.FlickDismissLayout>
```

Flick requires you to manually provide the content dimensions instead of it relying on the content View's dimensions. This is useful for scalable `ImageViews`, where the height will always be set to match-parent, but the actual image may or may not be consuming the entire space.

```kotlin
val callbacks = object : FlickCallbacks {
  override fun onFlickDismiss(animationDuration: Long) {
    // Called when the View has been flicked and the Activity
    // should be dismissed.
    flickDismissLayout.postDelayed({ finish() }, animationDuration)
  }

  override fun onMove(@FloatRange(from = -1.0, to = 1.0) moveRatio: Float) {
    // Called while this View is being moved around. Updating
    // background dimming is a good usecase for this callback.
  }
}

val contentSizeProvider = object : ContentSizeProvider {
  override fun heightForDismissAnimation(): Int {
    return imageView.zoomedImageHeight.toInt()
  }

  override fun heightForCalculatingDismissThreshold(): Int {
    // Zoomed in height minus the portions of image that has gone
    // outside display bounds, because they are longer visible.
    imageView.visibleZoomedImageHeight
  }
}

val flickDismissLayout: FlickDismissLayout = findViewById(...)
flickDismissLayout.gestureListener = FlickGestureListener(context, contentSizeProvider, callbacks)
```

**Intercepting flicks**

For usecases where the content can be scrolled further in the direction of the gesture, Flick exposes a way for intercepting flick detection,

```kotlin
// Block flick gestures if the image can pan further.
gestureListener.gestureInterceptor = { scrollY ->
  val isScrollingUpwards = scrollY < 0
  val directionInt = if (isScrollingUpwards) -1 else +1
  val canPanFurther = imageView.canScrollVertically(directionInt)

  when {
    canPanFurther -> InterceptResult.INTERCEPTED
    else -> InterceptResult.IGNORED
  }
}
```
